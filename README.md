# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-HDR
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | Tkinter GUI Sketchpad | Live Web-camera



**Problem Statement:**

When the eye perceives a certain image, the brain can quickly segment it and understand its many components. The brain goes through that process automatically, which includes not only the examination of the visuals, but also the interpretation of those images. Handwriting recognition plays a vital part in information processing in today's digital world. On paper, there is a huge amount of information, and processing digital files is less expensive than processing hardcopy. A handwritten recognition software's goal is to convert handwritten characters into formats that are machine readable. Vehicle license plate identification, postal letter sorting, and historical document preservation in archaeological departments, old document automation in libraries and banks, and other applications are among the most common.


**Objective:**

The goal of the proposed research is to obtain equivalent accuracy utilizing a pure CNN architecture for MNIST digit recognition by investigating the learning parameters in CNN architecture. Another goal is to look into the role of various hyper-parameters and fine-tune hyper-parameters that are important for boosting CNN architecture performance and also to apply the Convolutional Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits that have been trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a big collection containing handwritten images of digits 0-9 and finally build an interface for the user to use the notion as real time.


**Dataset:**

The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) dataset. This is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grey-scale pixel value.

**Algorithm:**

Various possible algorithm has analysed in this project.
-	K-Nearest Neighbor
-	Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
-	Convolutional Neural Network

Considering the limitation of each, CNN has chosen to build this model.

  CNN:
  A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a form of artificial neural network that is specifically intended to process pixel       input and is used in image recognition and processing. CNNs are image processing, artificial intelligence (AI) systems that       employ deep learning to do both generative and descriptive tasks. They frequently use machine vision, which includes image and   video recognition, as well as recommender systems and natural language processing (NLP).


**User Interface:**

A UI of both Web camera and GUI sketchpad has built as a real time notion.
